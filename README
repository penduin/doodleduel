doodleduel
==========
a two-player toy for cooperative/competitive doodling.

each of you start a drawing, swap canvases, and complete each others' doodle!
...or really just do whatever you want with it.  :^)


dependencies
------------
  node.js
you may also need to:
  npm install --save socket.io
  npm install --save express


to run
------
$ node server.js

then you and a friend can duel in doodles at http://yourserver:1138


future enhancements
-------------------
i have no idea if i'll get around to these.  feel like adding stuff like this
yourself?  i will happily accept pull patches, pull requests, or just more
ideas to pile here.  :^)
- picking your own color
- gather up events on the server in case someone joins late
- observer mode
- more-than-2-player mode?
