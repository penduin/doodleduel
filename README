doodleduel
==========
a two-player toy for cooperative/competitive doodling.

each of you start a drawing, swap canvases, and complete each others' doodle!
...or really just do whatever you want with it.  :^)


demo
----
you can get the idea of how doodle duel works here:
https://penduin.github.io/doodleduel/

it's not multiplayer, but you can see how it works on different devices etc.

perhaps sometime i will add support for multiple rooms and cached state and
enough other trimmings to make it worth sharing my own instance for all to
connect to.  in the meantime, run your own damn server.  :^)


dependencies
------------
  node.js
you may also need to:
  npm install --save socket.io
  npm install --save express


to run
------
$ node server.js

then you and a friend can duel in doodles at http://yourserver:1138


future enhancements
-------------------
i have no idea if i'll get around to these.  feel like adding stuff like this
yourself?  i will happily accept pull patches, pull requests, or just more
ideas to pile here.  :^)
- picking your own color
- gather up events on the server in case someone joins late
- observer mode
- more-than-2-player mode?
